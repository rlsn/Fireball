# Fireball

I made a ball battle game on Android!

It started as a [tutorial project](https://learn.unity.com/project/unit-4-gameplay-mechanics) for me to learn Unity, but I really liked the idea of the game so I adapted it to mobile devices to play on the subway. I added some rogue-like elements and several bosses to make it more challenging and fun. There is also a local leaderboard on your device so you can compete with your friends or yourself. 

Your goal is to survive on the ground for as long as possible. There are random upgrades for you to choose from in the beginning and after every boss fight, which grants and upgrades you skills. It also upgrades the powerups of the corresponding color.

I named the game fireball to pay tribute to the 'Fireball' foosball table on which I had so many good memories. Though the game has nothing to do with foosball;)

[Download](Fireball.apk?raw=true) and install the apk on your android and enjoy some ball crashes!
